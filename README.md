   Info:
   Tables:

Tables are the fundamental structure in an RDBMS. They store data in rows and columns.
Indexes:

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They are created on one or more columns of a table.
Primary Key:

A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identified.
Foreign Key:

A foreign key is a field in a database table that is a primary key in another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.
Normalization:

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Transactions:

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements executed as a single unit of work. It ensures data consistency and integrity.
Views:

A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It allows you to present data in a way that differs from the actual structure of the tables.
Stored Procedures:

Stored procedures are precompiled sets of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. They are stored and can be reused.
Triggers:

Triggers are sets of instructions that are automatically executed (or "triggered") in response to certain events, such as changes to data.
Constraints:

Constraints define rules that restrict the values in a database to maintain data integrity. Examples include UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints.
ACID Properties:

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions.
